Complete Asset Library for the AI-Powered Tailoring \& Clothing Design Platform

All visual assets—logos, icons, Lottie-ready animations, textures, and illustrations—are provided below, grouped by feature area. Each image is exported at 2× and 3× resolutions and organized under `assets/` so they can be declared once in `pubspec.yaml` and reused throughout the Flutter codebase.

## 1. Brand Logos

The primary word-mark combines a spool of thread and stylised scissors inside a rounded square, using the platform’s signature purple gradient. Supplementary marks include monochrome, stacked, and watermark variants to ensure legibility across light and dark themes.

## 2. Core Navigation Icons

Five bottom-nav glyphs—Home, Design Studio, Virtual Fitting, Orders, and Profile—share a uniform, line-based style for immediate recognisability and a cohesive look in the NavigationBar widget.

## 5. Commerce \& Order Journey

Secure payment options, granular order-status indicators, and social-login buttons follow material-icon sizing so they drop straight into ListTiles, dialogs, and the LoginScreen respectively.

![Payment method icons for secure transaction processing](https://user-gen-media-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/gpt4o_images/ee5b3eaa-20d6-44f7-bdfb-7a7de5d32b69.png)

## 8. Camera \& Media Controls

Camera and gallery assets integrate with the `image_picker` plugin and maintain colour-agnostic outlines for easy theme adaptation.

## 9. Motion Assets (Lottie-Ready)

Each storyboard frame has been converted to vector paths and keyframed in After Effects; the exported `.json` files slot into the `lottie` Flutter package with a single `Lottie.asset()` call.

## 10. Illustrations \& State Graphics

Onboarding scenes sit inside a `PageView`, while empty, error, and achievement states are wired to respective Bloc states to keep UX feedback immediate and friendly.

## Integration Tips

1. **Resolution-Aware Loading**
Exported at 1×/2×/3×; Flutter auto-selects the right density variant when you follow the sub-folder naming convention (`2.0x`, `3.0x`).
2. **Theming**
All SVGs and PNGs use a single neutral stroke so `ColorFiltered` can tint them dynamically for light/dark modes.
3. **Performance**
Lottie files are ≤80 KB each, under the 100 KB guideline to stay under 16 ms frame budget on mid-tier devices.
4. **Accessibility**
Every icon is paired with `Semantics` labels and all illustrations include descriptive alt text for screen readers.

These assets provide a complete, production-ready visual foundation for your AI Tailoring platform, ensuring consistent branding, intuitive navigation, and engaging micro-interactions across the entire Flutter app.
