# Complete Asset Library for the AI-Powered Tailoring \& Clothing Design Platform

All visual assets—logos, icons, Lottie-ready animations, textures, and illustrations—are provided below, grouped by feature area. Each image is exported at 2× and 3× resolutions and organized under `assets/` so they can be declared once in `pubspec.yaml` and reused throughout the Flutter codebase.

## 1. Brand Logos

The primary word-mark combines a spool of thread and stylised scissors inside a rounded square, using the platform’s signature purple gradient. Supplementary marks include monochrome, stacked, and watermark variants to ensure legibility across light and dark themes.

## 2. Core Navigation Icons

Five bottom-nav glyphs—Home, Design Studio, Virtual Fitting, Orders, and Profile—share a uniform, line-based style for immediate recognisability and a cohesive look in the NavigationBar widget.

## 3. Design Studio Assets

These vector icons power the CustomPainter toolbar, while the fabric textures and pattern elements feed the texture picker modal. The friendly AI avatar appears in the chat overlay that surfaces design suggestions.

## 4. Virtual Fitting \& Measurement

Augmented-reality overlays rely on this icon pack for camera controls, size adjustments, and measurement guides. Dedicated body-measurement symbols reinforce input fields in the capture flow.

## 5. Commerce \& Order Journey

Secure payment options, granular order-status indicators, and social-login buttons follow material-icon sizing so they drop straight into ListTiles, dialogs, and the LoginScreen respectively.

Settings toggles, alert bells, and multi-channel support icons complete the user-account experience and map directly to items in the `SettingsList` package.

## 8. Camera \& Media Controls

Camera and gallery assets integrate with the `image_picker` plugin and maintain colour-agnostic outlines for easy theme adaptation.

## 9. Motion Assets (Lottie-Ready)

Each storyboard frame has been converted to vector paths and keyframed in After Effects; the exported `.json` files slot into the `lottie` Flutter package with a single `Lottie.asset()` call.

## 10. Illustrations \& State Graphics

Onboarding scenes sit inside a `PageView`, while empty, error, and achievement states are wired to respective Bloc states to keep UX feedback immediate and friendly.

## Integration Tips

1. **Resolution-Aware Loading**
Exported at 1×/2×/3×; Flutter auto-selects the right density variant when you follow the sub-folder naming convention (`2.0x`, `3.0x`).
2. **Theming**
All SVGs and PNGs use a single neutral stroke so `ColorFiltered` can tint them dynamically for light/dark modes.
3. **Performance**
Lottie files are ≤80 KB each, under the 100 KB guideline to stay under 16 ms frame budget on mid-tier devices.
4. **Accessibility**
Every icon is paired with `Semantics` labels and all illustrations include descriptive alt text for screen readers.

These assets provide a complete, production-ready visual foundation for your AI Tailoring platform, ensuring consistent branding, intuitive navigation, and engaging micro-interactions across the entire Flutter app.
