## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Clean Architecture Pattern

```txt
┌─────────────────┐
│   Presentation  │ ← Screens, Widgets, Cubits
├─────────────────┤
│    Domain       │ ← Models, Services, Use Cases
├─────────────────┤
│      Data       │ ← Repositories, Data Sources
└─────────────────┘
```

### BLoC State Management Flow

```txt
UI Event → Cubit → Repository → Service → External API
    ↑                                            ↓
UI Update ← State ← Business Logic ← Data ← Response
```
